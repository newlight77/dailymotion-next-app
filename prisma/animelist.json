At that time, Baili Dongjun, who became the number one in the world, was the only grandson who was loved by thousands of people in the Houfu of Zhenxi. Although he has a father who is outstanding in kung fu and a mother who is the daughter of the head of the Wen family, he is not good at martial arts and prefers wine. After ten years, he will be able to brew the best wine. In the end, he stole a title deed from his home and traveled hundreds of miles to open a wine shop in Chaisang City. But a long street is already full of evil stars. Only he is really a young boy who is serious about making wine. Because of this, he was inexplicably involved in the dispute between the two major families. On the way, he accidentally met the wanderer Sikong Changfeng, who had no father and no mother, and the burning ink son Lei Mengzai, who came from Tianqi City, because he was grateful to each other. He decided to help Lei Mengsha rescue his good brother, Gu Jianmen, the son of Lingyun who was trapped in his house… This is an era of young talents, and no other era can surpass it. Xie Xuan, who later became Confucian Sword Immortal, Yan Zhantian, who became Angry Sword Immortal, Luo Qingyang, who became Lone Sword Immortal, etc., were all still unknown at this time. They were waiting for the day when they met each other, and then they became famous all over the world.",

However, Chen Xing started a feud with Jian Feikong, the son of the Vice Master, as soon as he entered the palace.",

For centuries, the righteous sects united to resist the tyranny of the Twelve Demon Sects. But with the sudden rise of demonic forces, the righteous sects are forced into retreat, standing on the brink of collapse. Li Wannian, an ordinary cultivator from the Jinyi Sect, dreams of a simple life, earning his salary and avoiding trouble. However, during a routine mission, he discovers a game-changing ability: the power to resurrect on the spot. Each time he dies, not only does he come back to life, but he also gains rewards based on how “heroically” he perishes. To grow stronger, Li Wannian must die gloriously and meaningfully—turning sacrifice into a path to becoming the strongest cultivator. Are you ready for a tale of epic sacrifices and ultimate triumphs?",

To reclaim his mother, who had betrayed the sect and fled to marry his father. The Chu Family, once a powerful clan, fell into ruins as all its experts were mercilessly slaughtered in the process. Originally betrothed to Shui Qian Yue of the Shui Family as a result of his father’s heroic rescue, fate took another cruel turn when the Patriarch of the Shui Family reneged on the agreement due to the misfortune that had befallen the Chu Family.

Enduring numerous trials and near-death experiences, he was saved by Luo Lei, only to witness Luo Lei’s murder by his enemies shortly after. His own demise came when he reached the pinnacle of the Martial Emperor Realm, betrayed by his closest friend whom he had considered a brother.

There is no magic, no fighting spirit, and no martial arts here, but there is a magical martial spirit. Everyone here, when they are six years old, will awaken their spirits in the Spirit Hall. Martial spirits include animals, plants, and utensils. Martial spirits can assist people in their daily lives. Some of the particularly outstanding spirits can be used to practice and fight.

Nine dragons and the mysterious bronze coffin made people wonder whether they came back to ancient times or just reached the other shore of the universe. A giant mythical world was unfolded, where immortality gradually appeared and paranormal events continuously occurred. Countless people started to find their own tracks (the Dao) in such a mythical realm. Their passion was like a turbulent ocean wave that would never cease.
