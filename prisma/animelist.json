A giant mythical world was unfolded, where immortality gradually appeared and paranormal events continuously occurred. Countless people started to find their own tracks (the Dao) in such a mythical realm. Their passion was like a turbulent ocean wave that would never cease. The heat in their blood was like erupting volcanoes. Their desire for power and immortality dragged them down to the chasm without knowing it. Thirty-three classmates held a reunion after graduating. Their friendship was tested as the bronze coffin took them away from earth and arrived on another unknown planet. The desire to live forced them to follow the path of the ancient gods. Entering a new world of cultivation, will any of them reach immortality, or will they all die along the way?",

When he jumped off a cliff to express his ambition, he found that he did not die. Instead, he came to another world with another identity, a world of martial arts named Douluo. There is no magic, no fighting spirit, and no martial arts here, but there is a magical martial spirit. Everyone here, when they are six years old, will awaken their spirits in the Spirit Hall. Martial spirits include animals, plants, and utensils. Martial spirits can assist people in their daily lives. Some of the particularly outstanding spirits can be used to practice and fight. This profession is the most powerful and glorious professional “soul master” on the Douluo Continent. The little Tang San began his journey of training as a soul master in the Holy Soul Village and came up with the dream of revitalizing the Tang Sect. When Tang Sect’s hidden weapons come to the Soul Land Continent and Tang San’s martial spirit awakens, can he recreate the glory of Tang Sect in this martial spirit world?",

For centuries, the righteous sects united to resist the tyranny of the Twelve Demon Sects. But with the sudden rise of demonic forces, the righteous sects are forced into retreat, standing on the brink of collapse. Li Wannian, an ordinary cultivator from the Jinyi Sect, dreams of a simple life, earning his salary and avoiding trouble. However, during a routine mission, he discovers a game-changing ability: the power to resurrect on the spot. Each time he dies, not only does he come back to life, but he also gains rewards based on how “heroically” he perishes. To grow stronger, Li Wannian must die gloriously and meaningfully—turning sacrifice into a path to becoming the strongest cultivator. Are you ready for a tale of epic sacrifices and ultimate triumphs?",

In a final act of defiance, he transforms himself into a blazing sun to confront the otherworldly demons. Little does he know that destiny’s chains are tightening, and his father’s presence remains a haunting memory.",
