# Organisms

Organisms are groups of molecules that are joined together to form a more complex UI component.
They are relatively independent and can function on their own.

Examples of organisms include:
- A header component that includes a logo, navigation, and search input field
- A footer component that includes copyright information, social media links, and a contact form
- A card component that includes an image, title, and description

Organisms are also reusable and can be combined to form even more complex components.
