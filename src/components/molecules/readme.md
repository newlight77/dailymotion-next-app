# Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms (basic HTML elements) that are bonded together to form a simple component.
They are the smallest functional units of a UI component.

Examples of molecules include:

- A form label and input field
- A button and its associated text
- A search input field and its associated button

Molecules are reusable and can be combined to form more complex components.
